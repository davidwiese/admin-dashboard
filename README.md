Sample admin dashboard practicing CSS grid.

**Link to project:** https://davidwiese.github.io/admin-dashboard/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

All grid, no flexbox.

## Optimizations

Since it is an admin dashboard, I didn't bother to make it responsive. I would like to create a responsive solution in the future for different screen sizes.

## Lessons Learned:

Knowing when grid or flex makes the most sense is best. This exercise was fun overall.
